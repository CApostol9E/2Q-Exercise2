			<h2> ABOUT ME</h2>
			<p>I'm just a normal student in OB. I do play video games like Pokemon, FNAF, SONIC, ROBLOX. That's just a few. My favorite characters in those categories(except ROBLOX) are Umbreon, Bonnie the Bunny, favorite ar version of a FNAF character is Ringmaster foxy. My favorite SONIC characters are Ray the flying squirrel and Shadow the Hedgehog. I also write stories in Wattpad, Quotev, and possibly AO3(Archive of Our Own). I have started here since Grade 1. I will possibly be here until Senior High, the future will decide that part. I kind of want to make a fnaf fangame. There's this contest called FanVerse Initiative! And there's loads of popular ones there. If I don't make it to Senior High. Then I will just cherish these memories whether it is good or bad with my former classmates who left OB already, and the friends/classmates that are in different sections.</p>
